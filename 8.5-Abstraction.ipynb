    "In your code, abstraction is involved in the following places:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The class `Vehicle` is an abstract base class. It uses the `ABC` module and has an abstract method `start_engine`. This means you cannot create a direct object of `Vehicle`, and subclasses must implement `start_engine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The method `start_engine` in `Vehicle` is marked with `@abstractmethod`. This hides the implementation details and only shows the required feature (the method signature) to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The function `operate_vehicle(vehicle)` works with any subclass of `Vehicle` that implements `start_engine`, without knowing how `start_engine` is implemented. This hides the complexity and shows only the necessary interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- Abstraction is used by defining an abstract base class (`Vehicle`) and abstract method (`start_engine`).\n",
    "- It hides the details and enforces a contract for subclasses.\n",
    "- The user interacts with the object through a simple interface, not worrying about the internal implementation."
