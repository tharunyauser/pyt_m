    "#### Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces"

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Polymorphism is a powerful feature of OOP that allows for flexibility and integration in code design. It enables a single function to handle objects of different classes, each with its own implementation of a method. By understanding and applying polymorphism, you can create more extensible and maintainable object-oriented programs."

    "## Important\n",
    "\n",
    "No, it is not mandatory to have a function outside the class (like a for loop) to demonstrate polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is about using the same method name for different types (classes), and being able to call that method on different objects—even if you do it inside or outside a class, or in a loop, or directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance alone is not polymorphism, but inheritance enables polymorphism. Polymorphism is shown when you use a common interface (like a method name) for different objects, and each object responds in its own way.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can show polymorphism even without a loop or an outside function:"

    "- Polymorphism is about different objects responding to the same method name in their own way.\n",
